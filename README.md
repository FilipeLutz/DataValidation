# Job App

- **Mobile Apps II Assignment 4**

## Project Description

This project is an Android application developed for managing job-related information and bookings. Built using Jetpack Compose and Room Database, "Job App" enables users to search for decorators based on location and availability, view detailed profiles, and initiate bookings.

### Key Features:
- **Search Decorators**: Users can enter a location and date range to search for available decorators, with results dynamically displayed.
- **Decorator Details**: On selecting a decorator, users can view details like name, location, contact, and availability.
- **Navigation and State Management**: Uses Composeâ€™s `remember` and ViewModel-based state management for efficient UI tracking and navigation.

### Screens:
- **Search Screen**: Users input search criteria, view a list of available decorators.
- **Details Screen**: Provides a detailed view of the selected decorator, with options to go back and search again.

### Technical Details:
- Utilizes **Jetpack Compose** for UI design and **Room Database** for data handling.
- **State Management** is implemented with `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, and ViewModel observables like `StateFlow`.
